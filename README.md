## Data Processing
Each of the folders NYC and Chicago contain the scripts necessary to clean all the data as well as the original data sets. The full cleaned datasets are located in the cleaned_data folders for each city. They are complete and ready to use, but to replicate the work, one can run the numbered jupyter notebooks in order to create and save the necessary files.

## Interactive Maps
The Map folder contains files for interactive maps that are generated using the Python library Folium. To view the maps, open the deisred html files in a browser. The maps are currently loaded with a sample of ten variables from the dataset. To add or remove features on the map, run the mapgeneration jupyter notebook to regenerate maps with desired feautures. Variables can be added using the function add_layer() and a column label in the dataset.
